As the end of the school year approaches, the IT department at CDS wants to ensure that all teachers have a smooth transition into the summer break. Amidst the flurry of grading, organizing classrooms, and tying up loose ends, it's easy to overlook essential IT tasks that can save time and prevent potential issues in the future.

Here are a few key reminders for our dedicated educators:

**1. Update Your Computers:**
Before you bid farewell to your classroom for the summer, take a moment to update your computer's operating system and software. These updates often include critical security patches and performance enhancements that keep your device running smoothly. By staying up to date, you not only ensure a more efficient workflow but also safeguard against potential cyber threats.

**2. Check Your Inventory:**
Now is an opportune time to conduct a quick inventory check of any IT equipment or devices assigned to you. Ensure that all laptops, tablets, projectors, or other school-provided technology are accounted for and in good condition. If you notice any discrepancies or issues, please report them to the IT department promptly so that we can address them before the new school year begins.

**3. Activate Vacation Replies:**
As you prepare to disconnect and recharge over the summer break, don't forget to activate your vacation reply in your work email. This simple step lets colleagues, parents, and students know that you're away and provides them with alternative points of contact for urgent matters. Setting up a vacation reply ensures that important communications are not overlooked and helps maintain professionalism even while you're out of the office.

In addition to these reminders, we encourage all teachers to back up any important files or documents to ensure that they're accessible when needed. Whether it's lesson plans, student records, or administrative documents, having a backup copy gives you peace of mind and prevents data loss.

As always, the IT department is here to support you throughout the year, including during the summer months. If you encounter any technical issues or have questions about IT-related matters, please don't hesitate to reach out to us for assistance. We're committed to providing reliable and efficient IT services to enhance teaching and learning at CDS.

Wishing you all a restful and rejuvenating summer break!

Go Wildcats!
