Welcome back educators! We are so happy to get the 2024-2025 school year started. To ensure that you are ready for the school year, we want to remind you of some technology tips and update you on some changes you should be aware of.

**Tips and Best Practices**

-Update your computers: Windows and Chrome users do not need to update as these computers will update on their own. Mac users, you have swiped away your update notification. Please go ahead and update the operating system on your computers. Macbooks should be running MacOS 14.6 Sonoma.

-Check your sign ins: Make sure that you can sign into all of your curricular sites. Remember that most of your sign ins are linked with your Google accounts.

-Check the printer: Make sure that you can print with a test print before you really need to print any bulk documents for students.

-Problems: Remember that if you have any questions or issues with your technology, you should send an email to [support@carolinaday.org](mailto:support@carolinaday.org) so that you can be helped as fast as possible.

**Updates for the New School Year**

-Technology Support Site: there is now a [CDS Technology Support Site](https://sites.google.com/carolinaday.org/cds-technology-support/home) where you can find helpful articles and guides for the different technology that educators use on campus. If you have a question about something that is not on the site, please let [Ryan James](mailto:rjames@carolinaday.org) know.

-Google SSO for students: last year Google made changes for all Google Education accounts. For all student accounts, they cannot use their Google account to sign in to **new** apps. Any new websites or apps must be approved by Google Admin prior to signing in. It doesn't take long for that process, but you will need to email support@carolinaday.org to get this done for you.

-Guest WiFi: we have posted QR codes around campus for the Guest WiFi. If you have any visitors that need access to the WiFi, they can scan those QR codes. 

-More Support from EO: from time to time we will have additional support from Electronic Office helping Logan. 

-And always, send your technology requests to [support@carolinaday.org](mailto:support@carolinaday.org). This creates tickets so that everyone in the Technology Department can respond in a timely manner.
