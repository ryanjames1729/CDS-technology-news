# Welcome Back, Educators!

Weâ€™re thrilled to kick off the 2024-2025 school year with you! To get you prepped and ready, here are some tech tips and updates to keep you in the loop. Letâ€™s dive in!

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Update Your Computers**: Windows and Chrome users, you're all set! Your computers handle updates automatically. Mac users, donâ€™t ignore those update notifications. Make sure your MacBooks are running MacOS 14.6 Sonoma. Trust us, your computer will thank you for it!

- **Check Your Sign-Ins**: Double-check that you can log into all your curricular sites. Most of these are tied to your Google accounts, so make sure youâ€™re all set!

- **Test Your Printer**: Before you print a mountain of documents for your students, run a test print. Itâ€™s better to catch any printer issues now than to discover them when youâ€™re knee-deep in paperwork.

- **Troubleshooting**: Got tech issues? Donâ€™t sweat it! Shoot an email to [support@carolinaday.org](mailto:support@carolinaday.org), and weâ€™ll get you sorted out as quickly as possible.

## Updates for the New School Year

- **Technology Support Site**: Weâ€™ve launched a [CDS Technology Support Site](https://sites.google.com/carolinaday.org/cds-technology-support/home) packed with helpful articles and guides for all your campus tech needs. If you have a question thatâ€™s not covered, give [Ryan James](mailto:rjames@carolinaday.org) a shout.

- **Google SSO for Students**: Heads up! Google has updated its policies. Student accounts can no longer use Google SSO to log into **new** apps. Any new sites or apps must be approved by Google Admin first. Itâ€™s a quick process, but youâ€™ll need to email [support@carolinaday.org](mailto:support@carolinaday.org) to get the ball rolling.

- **Guest WiFi**: Weâ€™ve got QR codes posted around campus for easy Guest WiFi access. If youâ€™ve got visitors who need to hop online, they can just scan those codes.

- **More Support from EO**: From time to time, weâ€™ll have extra help from the Electronic Office to support Logan. 

- **Always Reach Out**: For any tech requests, remember to email [support@carolinaday.org](mailto:support@carolinaday.org). This helps us create tickets so our Technology Department can jump on it promptly.

Hereâ€™s to a fantastic school year! ðŸŽ‰ If you have any questions or need support, weâ€™re just an email away. Happy teaching!
