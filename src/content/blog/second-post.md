Welcome back educators! We are so happy to get the 2024-2025 school year started. To ensure that you are ready for the school year, we want to remind you of some technology tips and update you on some changes you should be aware of.

**Tips and Best Practices**

-Update your computers: Windows and Chrome users do not need to update as these computers will update on their own. Mac users, you have swiped away your update notification. Please go ahead and update the operating system on your computers. Macbooks should be running MacOS 14.6 Sonoma.

-Check your sign ins: Make sure that you can sign into all of your curricular sites. Remember that most of your sign ins are linked with your Google accounts.

-Check the printer: Make sure that you can print with a test print before you really need to print any bulk documents for students.

-Problems: Remember that if you have any questions or issues with your technology, you should send an email to support@carolinaday.org so that you can be helped as fast as possible.
