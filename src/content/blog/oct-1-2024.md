# October in IT

*Update Note: This post has been updated following the events of Hurricane Helene*

October typically brngs alot of events at CDS. After the tragic events caused by Hurricane Helene, the month of October looks very different. If you are going to be working remotely and need any help from the IT department, please don't hesitate to reach out. We are here to support you and know that this is a hard time for everyone involved.

## Help with Starting Back Up

As we get closer to the campus reopening date, make sure that you are working towards preparing technology for that. You should make sure that your computer and your Chrome browser are up to date. Currently your Macbooks should be up to MacOS 15.0.1 and your Chrome browsers should be at Version 129.0.6668.90. 

You can update your Macbook Operating System by using the Settings app on your Macbook. You will need an Internet connection to do this. If you are still on MacOS 14 or earlier, this update will take some time. If you are planning to wait until your return to campus, please plan accordingly. Your Chrome browswer will update itself if you close Chrome and reopen it.

## Digital Citizenship

The IT department has been coming around to classes working with students on how to handle to their devices with care and how to sign in to their devices. This is the start to our focus on Digital Citizenship for the year. If you would like help from the IT department in your classes, please reach out to [Ryan James](https://www.commonsense.org/education/digital-citizenship-week) to make an appointment. Be on the lookout this month for [Digital Citizenship Week](https://www.commonsense.org/education/digital-citizenship-week) October 16 - October 20.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Patience with IT Infrastructure**: As we all return to campus later this month, there may be issues with our infrastructure such as the WiFi or printer access. Please contact us to let us know about these issues. We will work on these as quickly as we can to make sure that you all have everything you need to teach. 

- **CDS Support Site**: Have you seen the [CDS Technology Support Site](https://sites.google.com/carolinaday.org/cds-technology-support/home) yet? We have put many helpful articles there for teachers, students, and parents. The articles are filtered using your Google accounts. If students have questions about signing in or a specific feature of My CDS, feel free to direct them there first.

## Updates from the Technology Department

- **Macbook Upgrades**: For teachers using a Macbook that is from 2020 or older, we will be reaching out to you to get your older Macbook and upgrade you to a new model Macbook. We are upgrading Macbooks to limit the amount of issues that you may have with your current Macbook and to ensure that you will get all the security updates from Apple and Electronic Office.

- **From Previous Posts**: For our students that are comfortable using technology, don't forget that you can cut down on paper by using the technology in your rooms. Post welcome messages and bell ringers on your Interactive Boards, TVs, and projectors. You can also use your document cameras for a low tech version. Use digital tools like [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com), [Microsoft Onenote](https://onenote.com), and [Smart Notebook](https://www.smarttech.com) for your note delivery so that students can have access outside of class. To end class, use [Google Forms](https://forms.google.com) to 'take the temperature' of the class of where they are.

- **Always Reach Out**: For any tech requests, remember to email [support@carolinaday.org](mailto:support@carolinaday.org). This helps us create tickets so our Technology Department can jump on it promptly.

If you have any questions or need support, weâ€™re just an email away. Happy teaching!
