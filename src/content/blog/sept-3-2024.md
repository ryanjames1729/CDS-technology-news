# September is Here

Welcome back from our first extended weekend! I'm sure it felt good to get a break for everyone. The IT department would like to extend our thanks to everyone on campus for their understanding and patience during the first week of school. Our community has good success with rebooting when you have trouble connecting to the network or printers. If you are still experiencing issues with the connecting the staff network or printing, please let us know.

## Digital Citizenship

The IT department has been coming around to classes working with students on how to handle to their devices with care and how to sign in to their devices. This is the start to our focus on Digital Citizenship for the year. If you would like help from the IT department in your classes, please reach out to [Ryan James](https://www.commonsense.org/education/digital-citizenship-week) to make an appointment. Be on the lookout next month for [Digital Citizenship Week](https://www.commonsense.org/education/digital-citizenship-week) October 16 - October 20. 

## Tips and Best Practices

- **CDS Support Site**: Have you seen the [CDS Technology Support Site](https://sites.google.com/carolinaday.org/cds-technology-support/home) yet? We have put many helpful articles there for teachers, students, and parents. The articles are filtered using your Google accounts. If students have questions about signing in or a specific feature of My CDS, feel free to direct them there first.

- **Bell Ringers + Content + Exit Slips**: For our students that are comfortable using technology, don't forget that you can cut down on paper by using the technology in your rooms. Post welcome messages and bell ringers on your Interactive Boards, TVs, and projectors. You can also use your document cameras for a low tech version. Use digital tools like [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com), [Microsoft Onenote](https://onenote.com), and [Smart Notebook](https://www.smarttech.com) for your note delivery so that students can have access outside of class. To end class, use [Google Forms](https://forms.google.com) to 'take the temperature' of the class of where they are.

## Updates from the Technology Department

- **Macbook Upgrades**: For teachers using a Macbook that is from 2020 or older, we will be reaching out to you to get your older Macbook and upgrade you to a new model Macbook. We are upgrading Macbooks to limit the amount of issues that you may have with your current Macbook and to ensure that you will get all the security updates from Apple and Electronic Office.

- **Zoom and Google Meet**: As of September 2, CDS teachers will not have access to Zoom as we did from 2020 to this past summer. You should start using [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com) for any virtual meetings that you are hosting. You will still be able to attend Zoom meetings by using your CDS Google account. It is not recommended to host your virtual meetings using your CDS Google accounts because the IT Department cannot assist you with any technical difficulties.

- **Always Reach Out**: For any tech requests, remember to email [support@carolinaday.org](mailto:support@carolinaday.org). This helps us create tickets so our Technology Department can jump on it promptly.

Hereâ€™s to a fantastic school year! ðŸŽ‰ If you have any questions or need support, weâ€™re just an email away. Happy teaching!
